1.  Go to “Start” -> Open “Visual Studio 2015.” Note there are older version of VS2015; do not use them.
2.  In the Visual Studio startup screen, select “Open Project…” under “Start.” Alternatively, you can do File -> Open -> Project / Solution (Ctrl + Shift + O).

3.  In the file dialog that opens, go to “My Documents” -> “Visual Studio 2015” (NOT 2013 or 2010) -> “Projects” -> “VME_Interface” -> VME_Interface.sln. Alternatively, the full file path is C:\Users\SKIFFLAB\Documents\Visual Studio 2015\Projects\VME_Interface\VME_Interface.sln. Click “Open” to open the solution.
4.  MSVS2015 will open the full solution. There are a variety of projects inside this solution for different data acquisition processes. Navigate to the “VME_Interface” library: ![](vme_interface_cpp.jpg).
