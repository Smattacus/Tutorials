<p><strong>Tutorial: Writing a C++ Program using Visual Studio to call the VME Interface Library</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">By Sean Mattingly</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This document steps the user through creating a new project in Visual Studio that links to the already existing .DLL (or .LIB) library &ldquo;VME_Interface.dll&rdquo;. This library contains a number of routines for accessing the VME interface through V2718, setting up a data acquisition, downloading the data from the VME, and writing the data to the hard drive. I hope the library will be a good springboard for a student in the Skiff lab at the University of Iowa who wants to get started acquiring his or her own data for their own experiment.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This tutorial will also show the user where the code for the VME_Interface library is held for the future event if they want to modify it and add their own methods to it.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Finally, we will also cover the basics of creating a project in MS Visual Studio 2015, which includes creating the project itself, writing the C++ code, pointing the MSVS compiler / linker to the required libraries, compiling it, and running the resulting executable.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ol>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Go to &ldquo;Start&rdquo; -&gt; Open &ldquo;Visual Studio 2015.&rdquo; Note there are older version of VS2015; do not use them.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the Visual Studio startup screen, select &ldquo;Open Project&hellip;&rdquo; under &ldquo;Start.&rdquo; Alternatively, you can do File -&gt; Open -&gt; Project / Solution (Ctrl + Shift + O).</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the file dialog that opens, go to &ldquo;My Documents&rdquo; -&gt; &ldquo;Visual Studio 2015&rdquo; (NOT 2013 or 2010) -&gt; &ldquo;Projects&rdquo; -&gt; &ldquo;VME_Interface&rdquo; -&gt; VME_Interface.sln. Alternatively, the full file path is C:\Users\SKIFFLAB\Documents\Visual Studio 2015\Projects\VME_Interface\VME_Interface.sln. Click &ldquo;Open&rdquo; to open the solution.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">MSVS2015 will open the full solution. There are a variety of projects inside this solution for different data acquisition processes. Before we create a new project in this solution, I want to point out the &ldquo;VME_Interface&rdquo; library:</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the Solution Explorer, there are a number of solutions. At the bottom (of the time of writing) is the solution &ldquo;VME_Interface.&rdquo; The source file &ldquo;VME_Interface.cpp&rdquo; contains all the methods that we can call using the DLL. The header file &ldquo;VME_Interface_Funcs.h&rdquo; contains the declarations of the externally usable &nbsp;(&ldquo;public&rdquo;) functions. At this point, do NOT make any modifications to VME_Interface.cpp.</span></li>
</ol>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Now we will create a Project and add it to the VME_Interface solution. This way, MSVS2015 will play nice with references when we try to link the code we write to the functions inside VME_Interface.dll.</span></p>

<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Go to File -&gt; </span></li>
